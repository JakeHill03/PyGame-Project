Welome to Next Hop!

Next Hop was inspired by doodle jump, for which there are many examples online for. 
The major inspirations can be found within the CONTRIB File.

Next Hop tells the story of a Frog(the player character) as they make their perilous journey up a waterfall.
Along our hero's journey dangerous birds and moving lilly pads will cause you to tumble back down to earth. 
Flies supply you with much needed sustenance and will give you a boost!
The end goal however, is always just out of reach. So the true challenge is can you beat yourself!

This game was made by Louise Butterworth, Stephen Todd and Jake Hill.
