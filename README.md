# PyGame-Project

Hi, to instal this PyGame project 'Next Hop' you will need to clone this repository. 

You will also need a working python IDE, we used one through Anoconda for python 3.7 which can be obtained at this website
https://www.anaconda.com/download/ You will also need to have the PyGame libary installed which can be found here https://www.pygame.org/news

Once that is completed just open the main.py file and hit run within the IDE. A pop up window should then open and you'll be able to play Next Hop!
